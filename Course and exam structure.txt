The lessons structure is:
- a lesson dedicated to solve the challenges together (discuss and stuff) - not useful, the teacher will be present 
but it's only to discuss with the few other people
- a lesson dedicated to discuss and do the questionnaire on the recording the teacher puts for the week and where the
solution of previous challenge will be discussed (also probably discussed the current ones to solve)

It is advised to present at least once to get some bonus points (aka, solve a challenge and make slides about it). You tell
teacher in advance the first of the two lessons, then on the second one you will present. 
Advised structure: overview, resolving steps, flag part and security discussion.

The exam will be two hours, having:
- the theoretical part composed of 18 questions (1 hour)
- 4 challenges (1 hour)

Usually, there is no access to internet, but if there are sites that need to be accessed
in the exam, the teacher will allow internet and will tell us the sites to use.
